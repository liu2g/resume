I am currently working at [L&T Technology Service](https://www.ltts.com/) in Peoria, IL, but free to download my resume and contact me for future job opportunities.

I have created several versions of my resume, as I have multiple fields of interests and was not able to demonstrate all of them in one page.
- `Liu_hw_analog.pdf` for positions related to analog electrical engineering
- `Liu_hw_digital.pdf` for positions related to digital computer engineering
- `Liu_hw.pdf` for positions in electrical and computer engineering in general
- `Liu_sw.pdf` for positions related to the development of AI, machine learning, robotics, intelligent data analysis, etc.

I apologize for the confusion in advance and you can contact me at liu2z2@mail.uc.edu or 513-886-6058.
