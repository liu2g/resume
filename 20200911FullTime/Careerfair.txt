Good morning!

Good morning.  Tell me a little about yourself and your professional interests

09/16/2020 11:05 AM - Doug

Hello, my name is Liu. I am a senior year Electrical Engineering student looking for a full-time or an intership position starting in summer 2021. I am interested in a job related to embedded system and intelligent system engineering. Is there any job offerings or career recommendations for me?

09/16/2020 11:06 AM
 
We have multiple opening for application engineers to support embedded system development for customers across the Americas.  The core of these products would be our ARM-based microcontrollers, which would interface with our sensors, radios, encryption/security coprocessors and our memory and power electronics.  Applications  range from video door locks to wearable health monitors to satellites to marine radars.  Sound intersting?

09/16/2020 11:13 AM - Doug

They do! I am in general interested in all aspects in embedded systems. All of the applications you mentioned sound very exciting and matching for my skills and experience.

Can you upload your resume?

09/16/2020 11:18 AM - Doug

Sure. My resume is available on my eportfolio at https://liu2z2.wixsite.com/liuportfolio

Please briefly describe a microcontroller based project you have worked on and related challenges?

09/16/2020 11:20 AM - Doug

Last year I wanted to make a chiptune music system that uses an old school sound generator chip and Atmel MC as main controller. I prototyped a PCB that has a sound chip and let it communicate with the MC. 

09/16/2020 11:28 AM
My main challenge was that the chip I used (OPL2 if you may hear of it) did not have standard serial protocol so I had to find a communication method from the Atmel to the sound chip. Eventually after a thorough look at the document, I managed to use shift register and a few combination circuit to work it out

The project detail can be found at my portfolio at https://liu2z2.wixsite.com/liuportfolio/post/a-chiptune-musical-system-with-opl2-and-reality-adlib-tracker

I like your portfolio website!  Nicely done.  What development environments have you worked with and what OS/RToS's have you worked with?

09/16/2020 11:31 AM - Doug

At the high level, I worked with Python, MATLAB, Java and C++ before. At low level, I had projects in Verilog on FPGA, and wrote C code for embedded software. I am comfortable with both Windows and Linux OS -- did I answer your question, I am not too sure?

09/16/2020 11:37 AM
 
Have you taken any classes that have exposed you to RToS such as FreeRTOS for ARM Cortex-M, uCOS or MBed?  Embedded MCU applications rely heavily on these for task management/scheduling/interupt handling.  

09/16/2020 11:42 AM - Doug

Yes. I have worked with FreeRTOS for ARM Cortex-M before in an embedded system lab class. We briefly implemented the task management, memory allocation and interrupts on an Atmel chip. I have learned the other OS's too in class but not really used them myself before

What development tools have you used and can you describe how you utilized their features to debug/resolve issues?

09/16/2020 11:51 AM - Doug

I used MPLAB for PIC chip programming before. I used the debugger in the software to step into lines one at a time while watching registers. I have also used Atmel Studio, Visual studio before as development environment

09/16/2020 11:57 AM
 
Thanks.  As an application engineer you would be utilizing Linux or Android for applications based on A-class processors or Eclipse-based IDEs for embedded designs utilizing FreeRTOS for ARM Cortex-M, MBed, etc...

09/16/2020 12:08 PM - Doug

 
What exposure to wireless technologies have you had?

09/16/2020 12:08 PM - Doug

I have worked with Bluetooth and IEEE802-15 before. NFC is another one depending on if you think it's wireless 

09/16/2020 12:12 PM
 
NFC is definitely wireless per my thinking :-)   We support NFC in our security products used for payment systems and id's such as passports.

Please apply online for position 22582 and we can further our conversation.

Will do! Do you mind sending a Linkedin page so I could connect to you? It was very nice talking to you

09/16/2020 12:20 PM
Hello? Are you still there? Let me know if you could send me Linkedin page, if not have a nice day!

09/16/2020 12:39 PM
 
Sorry but I'm not a Linked In connection accumulator...  I can be reached at: doug.kearns@infineon.com

09/16/2020 12:50 PM - Doug

Oh I'm sorry. Usually at the end of in-person talk I would ask for a business card and but I could be wrong that Linkedin is an equivalent to that. Thanks for the email though!
